    "At Mercury's distance, the tidal force from the Sun would be drastically stronger compared to that from the Moon. This would mean the Sun would dominate the tidal patterns, with much higher tidal variations due to the Sun's proximity.\n",

    "At Jupiter's distance, the tidal force from the Sun would be significantly weaker. This would lead to the Moon having a dominant effect on tidal patterns, with much lower tidal variations due to the Sun's relative remoteness.\n",

    "If the Earth's water were present (ignoring evaporation or freezing), at Mercury's distance, we might expect larger tidal amplitudes due to the dominant Sun's tidal effect. In contrast, at Jupiter's distance, the tides would be predominantly controlled by the Moon with much muted solar tidal effects."

    "The Rings of Saturn start at about 7000km above the Saturnian “surface” and extend out to about 80,000km. Given that the average density of Saturn is 687 kg m−3 and its equatorial radius is 60,300 km, calculate the density of a moon that would just avoid tidal disruption (a) at the innermost ring and (b) at the outermost ring. You should use a value of 2.5 for the scaling factor in the Roche Limit equation as this is more realistic than the 1.3 given by the simple assumptions in the lecture.\n",
    "Comment on how these compare to the typical density of a Moon of Saturn.\n",

    "After finding these densities, you can compare them to the typical density of a Moon of Saturn. For example, the moon Enceladus, which resides within the E-ring of Saturn, has a density of approximately 1,609.4 kg/m^3. If the calculated densities are significantly less than this value, then moons like Enceladus can exist close to Saturn without being torn apart by tidal forces. If the calculated densities are higher, it suggests that moons with densities typical of Enceladus would be at risk of tidal disruption at those distances.\n"
